Today was cleanup time. I broke a gigantic index.js into manageable pieces and tried to tidy some of the mess that I did while I was building the concept.

I made some progress with the storage, and I have a few ideas for abstracting different providers. I'd love to start capturing three times a week to have data for feeding the frontend of the project.
