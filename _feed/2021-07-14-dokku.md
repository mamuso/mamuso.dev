Please, when I die, engrave in my headstone "I'm starting a new side project."

I registered whatthemap.com six years ago and wtmap.co earlier this year. I may be the only person on earth who thinks that products for building a collaborative map are crap.

Anyhoo, I wanted to deploy a little Rails app using [Dokku](http://dokku.com) and Docker, and it was pretty painless!
